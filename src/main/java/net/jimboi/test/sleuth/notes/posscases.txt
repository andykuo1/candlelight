The Game:
You arrive on the crime scene. There are 5 suspects and a victim. The Victim
was stabbed to death. You've been told that Joe did it. His fingerprints are
on the weapon. Why?


So the game has 2 sections:

Whodunit?
- How did the victim die?
- Who could have caused this?

Whodunit can usually be solved by investigation. And usually involves
connecting / converging evidence and realizing staged evidence. Here you find
 the answer.

To generate, the murderer needs to know requirements and effects, and plan
the course of action.
