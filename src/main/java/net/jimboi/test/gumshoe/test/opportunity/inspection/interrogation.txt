Initial sim-style conversation to determine Friendship levels.

Query systems
- Integrity (based on relationship and traits)
- Gets all memories
- But only shows the most recent relevant memories (3)
- "I don't remember anything about _____" (this is also a clue)
- "I don't know anything about that."
    - can be used as a contradiction
- "I don't want to talk about ______" (there are memories, but too low relationship)

- Certain words are associated to guilt.
    - If so, can cause harm to interrogation if used indiscriminately

- If player can chain relevant questions that have no Guilt,
    it becomes easier to ask questions with Guilt

Example:
    Ask about... cars.
        "I remember: At backyard - 3:10, I heard a car drive by."
    Anything else?...
        "That is all I remember about cars (keep list)"
        or
        "There is something else, but I can't remember." (if reached limit of most recent)
    Describe..."I heard a car drive by" (for time and location, source, etc.)
        "It was at 3:10, in my backyard."

PROBLEMS:
    What if more than MAX memories all have the same keywords?
        - Should display all of them as 1 memory.
    How to determine Guilt of a query?
        - Determined by goal/secret.

Memories:
    Time of Conception
    Location of Conception
    Source of Memory(THIRD or FIRST)
    Content = (subject)(action)[object]

Everyone should keep a real, simulated memory bank.
Deceivers will construct filters to alter the query system.
- Can omit memories
- Can change content
- Can also create memories with keyword to hide other memories.


What determines these omissions?
- Traits
    - Liar
    - Forgetful
    - Secretive
- Goals
    - Get away with murder
    - Hide affair
- Circumstance(Blackmail)

- Protect Self
- Protect Goal
- Protect Image
- Protect Relationship
