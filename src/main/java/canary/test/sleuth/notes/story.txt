WOAH!
...
Are you real?
...
Nod for yes.
Shake for no.
...
(if answered) Huh. You can understand what I'm thinking.
(if not) Figures. A giant head floating in space. Don't know what I was thinking.
Weird. This must be a dream.
Do you feel pain? Is it cold in there?
Hm. That sucks. Wouldn't want to be you.
Well, I'm going to wake up now.
It's a big day tomorrow. It's my first case on the job.
Gotta make a good impression this time. Heh heh.
See you around.

(He wakes up and finds you still staring at him.)
(He goes through his morning routine and goes to work.)
(Someone passes by and greets him.)
(He replies, then points at the screen.)
(The person looks, then shakes his head.)
Strange...
Are you my guardian angel? I imagined they would look a lot more... nevermind.
(if the player clicks, he will stop and says:) Do that again.
(he waits for a click.) That feels strange.
(if the player clicks on him.) I felt that.
(if the player clicks on something else.) I see that.
(if the player does it multiple times.) Alright, knock it off. It's getting old.
(if the player clicks on someone else.) That's rude.
(later on, he will ask the player for help in the bathroom.)
