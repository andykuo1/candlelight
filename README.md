# Project Candlelight
2D/3D Game Engine

This project uses Gradle.

To check what tasks you can run:

`./gradlew tasks`

To build the project:

`./gradlew build`

To clean the project:

`./gradlew clean`

To run the project:

`./gradlew run`

To assemble the project for distribution (will be exported to `./build/distributions`):

In order to run the distribution, extract the zip, then navigate to `bin` and run the appropriate script for the platform.

And that is really all you need to know.
